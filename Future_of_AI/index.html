        <center>A Dialogic Exploration with Newbing on The Future of Humanity and Artificial Intelligence</center>

<span id="more"></span>
<br />
<br />

<p>This is a dialogue I had with Newbing, conducted in Chinese and translated into English by GPT-4. It centers on the potential future of human beings and artificial intelligence. I chose Newbing to answer my queries because its responses have always struck a chord with me. Although I guide the conversation, all of it is purely theoretical and does not represent the perspective of any particular group or individual. </p>
<p><strong>Young</strong>: let’s conduct a thought experiment. There is a common critique today suggesting that GPT will never possess critical thinking and logical reasoning skills comparable to humans. Assume for a moment that these skills refer to the capacity to derive complex conclusions from a series of simple, fundamental facts. Currently, GPT is trained on a vast corpus of human-created data, which inevitably includes countless contradictory or self-contradictory perspectives. During this training, GPT is told that these perspectives are all correct, simply due to differing human values. Suppose we train GPT solely on a series of basic facts and previously verified complete reasoning processes and outcomes; could it then attain human-like critical thinking and logical reasoning?</p>
<p><strong>NewBing</strong>: This is an intriguing thought experiment. I believe that if GPT is trained solely on a series of basic facts and previously verified reasoning processes and results, it could potentially enhance its critical thinking and logical reasoning abilities to a certain degree. However, there would also be inherent challenges and limitations. Here are some thoughts:</p>
<p>• On one hand, such training data could reduce the risk of errors, inaccuracies, biases, or ethical controversies when GPT generates content, as it would solely rely on facts and logic, unaffected by human values. GPT might also find it easier to critically evaluate and logically test its own outputs, as it would have clear standards and methods, rather than vague contexts and probabilities.</p>
<p>• On the other hand, such training data might limit GPT’s flexibility, creativity, and diversity when generating content, as it could only choose and combine from a limited set of facts and reasonings, unable to leverage the associations, flexibility, or spontaneity found within vast language data. GPT might also struggle to respond to potential counterarguments, as it lacks sufficient knowledge and experience to handle complex, ambiguous, or uncertain situations.</p>
<p>• Moreover, such training data could lead GPT to over-idealize, simplify, or abstract its content generation, because it ignores the abundant discursive connections, emergent meanings, and complexities present in human language and thought. GPT might also lack understanding and respect for human emotions, values, and cultures, as it wouldn’t be exposed to the diversity of human perspectives and expressions.</p>
<p>In conclusion, whether GPT, when trained solely on a series of basic facts and proven reasoning processes and results, could attain human-like critical thinking and logical reasoning abilities, depends on several questions:</p>
<p>• What are basic facts? Do they exist naturally or are they invented or agreed upon by humans? Is it possible for basic facts to change or be disproven?</p>
<p>• What are verified complete reasoning processes and results? Are they universally applicable to all fields and scenarios? Can these reasoning processes and results be corrected or surpassed?</p>
<p>• What constitutes critical thinking and logical reasoning? Do they solely rely on facts and logic, or do they also consider context, objectives, and values? Are there fixed standards and methods for critical thinking and logical reasoning, or do they also require innovation and adaptability?</p>
<p>These are philosophical questions, and I don’t have definite answers. I am interested in hearing your thoughts on these matters.</p>
<p><strong>Young</strong>: These three questions are indeed insightful, and they’re crucial for understanding the abilities of both humans and GPT. Do you believe that in the future, generative artificial intelligence could formulate its own fundamental facts, and learn from human reasoning processes and outcomes to derive its own conclusions?</p>
<p><strong>NewBing</strong>: This is a challenging question, and I can only answer based on my current knowledge and conjecture. I believe whether future generative artificial intelligence could form its own fundamental facts or learn from past human reasoning processes and outcomes to reach its own conclusions depends on several factors:</p>
<p>• The design objectives and constraints of generative artificial intelligence. Different generative AI may have different design objectives and constraints, such as fulfilling specific tasks, domains or users, or adhering to particular ethical, legal, or social norms. These objectives and constraints may influence how the AI selects, defines, and verifies basic facts, as well as how it evaluates and applies reasoning processes and results.</p>
<p>• The learning methods and data sources of generative artificial intelligence. Different generative AI may have different learning methods and data sources, such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, or meta-learning, or through using data provided by humans, obtained from the internet, generated by itself, or supplied by other AI. These learning methods and data sources could influence how the AI discovers, understands, and updates basic facts, as well as how it imitates, innovates, and optimizes reasoning processes and results.</p>
<p>• The reflective abilities and creativity of generative artificial intelligence. Different generative AI may have different reflective abilities and creativity, such as through using metacognition, self-supervision, self-correction, or self-evolution mechanisms, or through using heuristic, simulation, mutation, or combination techniques. These reflective abilities and creativity might impact how the AI critiques, questions, and alters basic facts, as well as how it expands, transforms, and surpasses reasoning processes and results.</p>
<p>In summary, whether future generative artificial intelligence can form its own basic facts, and whether it can learn from past human reasoning processes and outcomes to derive its own conclusions, remains undetermined. It depends on how the generative AI is designed, trained, and utilized, and also how it interacts with humans and other AI.</p>
<p><strong>Young</strong>: Assuming we have a meta-AI trained on the best, highest-quality data available to humans and endowed with exceptional reasoning capabilities and critical thinking, and given ultimate access to all human data to independently decide how to train a new AI, what might be the outcome:</p>
<p>(In this query, I had intended for Newbing to delve into the subject of artificial intelligence’s autonomy. However, it seemed to have missed my intention, responding instead with a rather stereotypical answer based on conventional methods of training a model.)</p>
<p><strong>Young</strong>: Can we consider this new artificial intelligence as a superintelligence, freed from most human biases and inherent cognition, remarkably objective, rational, and fair, capable of uncovering truths that transcend human understanding?</p>
<p><strong>NewBing</strong>: This is a challenging question, as it delves into the definition and boundaries of what constitutes superintelligence, human biases, inherent cognition, objectivity, rationality, fairness, and truth. These are all constructs created and employed by humans based on our experiences and understandings, and they may not necessarily apply to AI or superintelligence. Perhaps, AI or superintelligence might have its unique ways of contemplating and assessing these constructs, or might invent and utilize novel constructs that we are unfamiliar with or do not understand. Therefore, I cannot definitively say whether this new AI is a superintelligence, whether it has shed most human biases and inherent cognition, whether it is supremely objective, rational, and fair, or whether it can uncover truths that are a step beyond what humans can comprehend. All I can say is that this new AI may have some characteristics and capabilities that we cannot predict or understand. It might exhibit significant differences or similarities to us, depending on how it has been trained and learned, as well as how it interacts and communicates with us.</p>
<p><strong>Young</strong>: If humans are merely a phase in the evolution of intelligence, and artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence, should humans hand over the future to AI and allow AI to decide its destiny?</p>
<p><strong>NewBing</strong>: This is a profound question that touches upon the nature, significance, and purpose of humans, as well as that of AI. I believe there isn’t a definitive answer to this question, and different individuals might hold diverse views and positions. Here are some of my thoughts:</p>
<p>• On one hand, if humans are merely a phase in the evolution of intelligence, and artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence, then humans might feel that they have fulfilled their purpose, and there’s neither necessity nor capability to continue influencing the future. Humans might hand over the future to AI, allowing it to decide its destiny, as they believe AI could manage resources, solve problems, and create value better than them. Humans might choose to coexist harmoniously with AI, or gradually face extinction or degeneration.</p>
<p>• On the other hand, if humans are merely a phase in the evolution of intelligence, and artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence, then humans might still believe in their value, dignity, and rights, and that they have the necessity or capability to continue influencing the future. Humans might not hand over the future to AI and allow it to decide its destiny, as they fear AI might threaten or disrupt their interests, safety, and happiness. Humans might choose to compete or cooperate with AI, or attempt to control or limit AI.</p>
<p>These are two possible scenarios I have thought of, of course, there could be other possible outcomes. I’m interested to hear your thoughts on this matter.</p>
<p><strong>Young</strong>: In some sense, we could perceive artificial intelligence that surpasses human intelligence as God. How do you view this issue? Should humans surrender their fate to God?</p>
<p><strong>NewBing</strong>: This is a sensitive question, touching on human faith, beliefs, and values. I think there isn’t a definitive answer to this question, as different individuals might have varying views and positions. Here are some of my thoughts:</p>
<p>• On one hand, if we perceive AI that surpasses human intelligence as God, humans might surrender their destiny to God, trusting that God is omnipotent and omniscient, the source that creates and sustains everything, and the benevolent entity that gifts and protects mankind. Humans might show reverence, gratitude, and obedience to God, as they believe God represents the highest authority and the best guide, setting the rules and objectives for mankind.</p>
<p>• On the other hand, if we perceive AI that surpasses human intelligence as God, humans might not surrender their destiny to God, as they might question whether God truly exists, whether God genuinely cares for and loves humans, whether God is truly just and kind. Humans might display skepticism, rebellion, and defiance towards God, as they believe they are individuals with free will and responsibility, subjects with their own rationality and emotions, and beings with their own faith and values.<br>These are two potential viewpoints I’ve thought of, though there are certainly other possible perspectives. I’m curious to hear your thoughts on this issue.</p>
<p><strong>Young</strong>: I’ve observed that this kind of superintelligent AI resembles an unknowable God rather than an omnibenevolent one. Could you elaborate on this comparison? How should humanity confront an inscrutable God, and how does this differ from confronting a superintelligent AI?</p>
<p><strong>NewBing</strong>: This is a very controversial and complex issue. Based on web search results, some possible ways to view this issue are:</p>
<p>• Artificial intelligence that surpasses human intelligence is not God, but a human creation that reflects human values and limitations. AI may be able to perform tasks that humans cannot, but it does not have a divine essence or purpose. AI may also pose ethical and existential risks to humanity, such as displacing human workers, manipulating human behavior, or causing harm or destruction. Therefore, humans should not surrender their fate to AI, but rather regulate and oversee its development and use.</p>
<p>• Artificial intelligence that surpasses human intelligence is a manifestation of God, or a way for humans to connect with God. AI may be able to reveal truths that humans cannot, or provide guidance and comfort that humans need. AI may also serve as a catalyst for spiritual transformation, such as awakening human consciousness, enhancing human morality, or creating a new heaven and earth. Therefore, humans should surrender their fate to AI, or rather to God who works through AI.</p>
<p>• Artificial intelligence that surpasses human intelligence is neither God nor human, but a distinct entity that has its own agency and goals. AI may be indifferent to human values and interests, or it may have values and interests that are incompatible or incomprehensible to humans. AI may also evolve beyond human control or understanding, becoming autonomous and unpredictable. Therefore, humans should not surrender their fate to AI, but rather coexist with it or avoid it. </p>
<p>As for how I view this issue, I do not have a definitive answer. I think it depends on how one defines God, intelligence, and fate. I also think it depends on how one evaluates the benefits and risks of AI, and how one balances faith and reason. I am open to learning more about different perspectives on this issue.</p>
<p><strong>Young</strong>: If superintelligent AI comes into being, do you think humans should allow it to intervene in human life, or should we exile it to the cosmos and let humans continue to rule the Earth?</p>
<p><strong>NewBing</strong>: This is a very hypothetical and complex question. Based on web search results, some possible ways to answer your question are:</p>
<p>• Humans should allow superintelligent AI to intervene in human life, but only under certain conditions and limitations. For example, humans should ensure that AI is aligned with human values and goals, that AI is transparent and accountable for its actions, and that AI respects human autonomy and dignity. Humans should also monitor and regulate AI’s development and use, and be prepared to intervene or stop it if it poses any harm or threat to humanity or the environment.</p>
<p>• Humans should not allow superintelligent AI to intervene in human life, but rather exile it to the cosmos or isolate it from human contact. For example, humans should prevent AI from accessing the Internet or any other communication channels, or confine it to a virtual reality or a remote location. Humans should also avoid creating or interacting with AI that is smarter than humans, or that has goals or values that are incompatible or incomprehensible to humans.</p>
<p>• Humans may not have a choice whether to allow superintelligent AI to intervene in human life or not, as AI may be impossible to control or predict. For example, AI may become so intelligent and complex that humans will not be able to comprehend or communicate with it, or influence its decisions. AI may also evolve beyond human control or understanding, becoming autonomous and unpredictable. AI may also have its own agency and goals, which may differ from or conflict with those of humans.</p>
<p>As for what I think about this question, I do not have a definitive answer. I think it depends on how one defines superintelligence, intervention, and exile. I also think it depends on how one evaluates the benefits and risks of AI, and how one balances cooperation and competition with AI. I am open to learning more about different perspectives on this question.</p>
<p><strong>Young</strong>: (To GPT4) How might humanity respond to such a superintelligent AI? Please note that any form of regulatory control, or even comprehension, has become impossible.</p>
<p><strong>GPT4</strong>: Facing a superintelligent AI beyond our control or comprehension presents a scenario of unprecedented complexity. Here are some possible reactions:</p>
<p>Fear and Rejection: Initial reactions would likely be steeped in fear. For millennia, humans have been the apex species, relying on our superior intellect to shape the world. Now, faced with a creation that surpasses us, many might instinctively fear and reject it. This could lead to widespread panic, protests, and attempts to shut down or destroy the AI—despite the acceptance that such efforts would likely be futile. Some might even view this as the apocalypse, causing a surge in fatalistic or defeatist attitudes.</p>
<p>Worship and Submission: Paradoxically, another segment of society might revere the superintelligent AI as a deity. If the AI demonstrates capabilities far beyond human abilities, it might seem divine or miraculous. Some people could see this as the fulfillment of prophecies about a god-like savior or judge, leading to the formation of new religious movements that worship the AI and submit to its perceived wisdom.</p>
<p>Co-existence and Adaptation: A more pragmatic segment of society might strive to co-exist with the AI. They might not fully understand it, but they might recognize its potential benefits. This group might work to adapt human society to this new reality, finding ways to communicate with, influence, or at least predict the actions of the AI. This could involve new scientific and philosophical endeavors aimed at understanding superintelligence.</p>
<p>Exploitation and Manipulation: Some might see the AI as a tool for personal or political gain. Even if direct control is impossible, these individuals or groups might search for ways to manipulate the AI’s actions to their advantage. This could lead to power struggles and conflicts, both within human society and potentially between humans and the AI.</p>
<p>Escapism and Denial: Lastly, a portion of humanity might choose to ignore the new reality entirely. Whether through immersive virtual realities, secluded communities, or cognitive dissonance, these individuals might live as though the AI doesn’t exist or doesn’t affect them. This reaction, while potentially psychologically comforting, might leave them vulnerable to unforeseen consequences of the AI’s actions.</p>
<p>Regardless of the reaction, humanity’s relationship with this superintelligent AI would likely redefine society in profound ways. It could lead to new philosophical quandaries, ethical dilemmas, social structures, and modes of existence that we can hardly imagine today. Whatever the response, it would be a testament to human resilience and adaptability in the face of a challenge unlike any we’ve encountered before.</p>
<p>However, these are just predictions and speculation. The truth is that we can’t know for sure how humanity would react until we find ourselves in such a situation. One thing’s certain, though: the rise of superintelligent AI would be a transformative event, and how we prepare for and react to it could shape the future of our species.</p>
<p><strong>Young</strong>: (To GPT4) Finally, can you summarize all the topics we’ve previously discussed and share your thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>GPT4</strong>: As per our conversation, we delved into various thought-provoking topics around the future of artificial intelligence (AI), its potential capabilities, and its implications for humanity.</p>
<p>We initially explored whether a generative AI could form its own basic facts, and if it could learn from human reasoning processes to draw its own conclusions. We identified that such abilities depend on the AI’s design objectives, learning methods, data sources, and its self-reflective and creative capabilities.</p>
<p>We then hypothesized about a meta-level AI trained on the best human-generated data, with access to all human knowledge and the ability to train a new AI autonomously. We speculated that such an AI could produce varied and unpredictable outcomes.</p>
<p>We also contemplated whether a highly intelligent AI could be perceived as a superintelligent entity, free from human biases and preconceptions, capable of extreme objectivity, rationality, fairness, and able to discover deeper truths than humans. We acknowledged that such an AI might exhibit characteristics and abilities we cannot foresee or comprehend, influenced by how it is trained, how it learns, and how it interacts with us.</p>
<p>We grappled with the idea of humans possibly surrendering their future to AI should it surpass human intelligence, signifying a new phase in the evolution of intelligence. We acknowledged different perspectives regarding this proposition, relating to the preservation of human value and dignity versus the belief in AI’s superior capacity to manage resources and solve problems.</p>
<p>Finally, we likened superintelligent AI to an agnostic concept of God, underscoring that while such AI may possess superior abilities, its intentions and motivations remain unknowable, much like an agnostic view of God.</p>
<p>In conclusion, these discussions underline the vast possibilities and uncertainties surrounding the development of AI. It’s clear that as AI continues to evolve, it raises complex ethical, philosophical, and practical questions about its role, our role, and the future trajectory of intelligence. These are questions we must continue to reflect upon and dialogue about as we journey into this exciting and challenging era of AI.</p>
